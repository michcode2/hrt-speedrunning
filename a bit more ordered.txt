According to GMC guidelines, if a patient is DIYing or is likely to DIY (1), the patient is at risk of self harm from not having hormones (2) and the GP has asked a GIC (3), it is safe to give a bridging prescription

(1) you already have a bridging prescription so make sure to say that during the assessment

(2) this is gonna be where the history of personal and family mental heath will be relevant, I made sure to talk about how dysphoria has affected me throughout my life even when I didn't realise it at the time.

(3) for my GP, this was sending an email to the Leeds and York GIC. They said to my GP to prescribe the "lowest possible dose acceptable in the circumstances". Just say you will carry on DIYing to increase the dose if they don't prescribe the same dose you have and hopefully they'll prescribe more. They might also say no anti androgen because its more of a risky thing to do, so be aware but don't push too hard on it because there's always the risk they'll just say no to everything if you try and push your luck too far

^^^main stuff to remember^^^

I also mentioned how I've been socially transitioning in addition to history of dysphasia so the GP could see I was taking it seriously

Showing knowledge of the side effects of the different forms of HRT can't hurt
