assuming you have a supportive GP (cant hurt to try i guess?)
https://genderkit.org.uk/resources/hrt-without-diagnosis/ has the information you need 
in summary, if you are DIYing or about to DIY, GMC practice says that you should get a bridging prescription

https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare#Mental%20health%20and%20bridging%20prescriptions
the last part of that link means that your GP will probably ask a GIC about it, because trans healthcare is somehting that most GPs wont know a lot about
you will almost definitely be given the lowest possible dose, but this is (anecdotally) enough to see some changes

when talking to my GP, i mentioned my history of gender dysphoria and how it affects me, the fact that i know where to get the medicines to DIY, personal/fimily history of mental health stuff, and i brought up the GMC guidance i linked above so that my GP had enough information

had a fasting blood test, got some information that my GP got from a GIC, signed a form saying i know this isnt an approved use and that if i regret anything, thats on me, and then i got my prescription the same day i sent in a picture of the signed form
